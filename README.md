# toy_5

## About:

This networked piece, written for new media group Ensemble Decipher and titled toy_5, seeks to explore aspects of 
improvisational and generative algorithmic computer music. The work is designed to be immediately accessible to 
non-musicians through a participatory setting, if so desired, according to principles developed by Tina Blaine and 
Sidney Fels, while also providing the opportunity for more rehearsed performances like the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQjoRHxn-c. 

The workâ€™s visuals and sound are controlled by
mouse cursor position, mouse clicks, and keystrokes through OSC. They are then shared, in this case through the 
consumer-grade teleconferencing software Zoom. The code 
for audio generation was written in SuperCollider, while the visuals were coded in hydra.  The work is easily 
appropriated into live settings or with better music networking software like JackTrip.

Simply follow the instructions in the score and in the SuperCollider files.
It is recommended that the bass part is performed by maximum two players,
and the chimes parts maximum four. The granulation part should be played by one
or two players.
